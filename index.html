    <h3>Visualizing Euler's Identity</h3>
    <div style="width : 820">
    <p>Euler's identity is one of the most famous mathematical expression, in
      at least small part because at first glance it looks completely
      nonsensical. My goal is to give at least some vague intuition and turn
      the nonsensical into the somewhat-sensical.

      I am using following equation and varying m to approximate and show the
      exponential function with a complex argument. As m increases, the
      approximation gets more accurate.
